        <p>I'm a 7 (almost 8) year old Golden Retriever/Chow Chow mix who lives in the
        beautiful Pacific Northwest with my dads. We live in Seattle, which is the largest city in both
        the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest.<sup><a href="#">1</a></sup> We really like it here!

          Seattle is a seaport city on the west coast of the United States and the seat of King County, Washington. With an estimated 704,352 residents as of 2016, Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America.
          In July 2013, it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%. In July 2016, Seattle was again the fastest-growing major U.S. city, with a 3.1% annual growth rate.
          The city is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canadaâ€“United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015.
